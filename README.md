## Prerequisites:
- A prior knowledge of calculus and complex numbers is required.
- Should have taken the course Network Signals and Systems.

This is the repository containg source code for the labs conducted at IIITH. The labs involved :
- Continuous-time and discrete-time signals using various representations.
- Applying various transforms including Fourier transform, DTFT, and Z- transform to studysignals and systems
-  Applying sampling theorem to do analog-to-digital conversion of signals, perform idealand non-ideal reconstruction of signal from its samples
-  Examining computational complexity of efficient DFT implementations using FFT.
-  Designing digital filters with specified requirements to process signals.
-  Analyzing systems and real-world signals using signal processing tools in MATLAB software.
-
